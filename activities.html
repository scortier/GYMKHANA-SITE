                  <h1>Diwali</h1>
                  Diwali, one of the most auspicious festivals of India,
                  celebrates the victory of good over evil. The festival of
                  light spreads happiness, prosperity and well being of
                  everyone. In NITS, we celebrated the festival of light with
                  great enthusiasm and love. All the boarders of each and every
                  hostel celebrated the auspicious occasion with great
                  excitement. The whole campus of NIT Silchar was glowing with
                  the shine of the magnificent diyas and colourful lights, on
                  the pristine occasion of Diwali which was celebrated on the
                  11th of November. On that day the students got actively
                  involved in making beautiful Rangolies and decorating their
                  hostels thereby creating an amazing festive mood throughout
                  the campus. This year GH-2 took the initiative and organised
                  the Kali Puja in which the whole of NIT Silchar was invited,
                  to witness the ceremony and seek the blessings of Goddess
                  Kali.

                  of the entire fraternity filled the atmosphere. The event
                  began with an inspiring, kindling speech by Honourable
